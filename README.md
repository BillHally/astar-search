# astar-search

A* Search algorithm in F#.

Classic algorithm, as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm.

In contrast to the pseudo-code in that article, this version is purely functional/immutable

Core code is in the AStar.fs/AStar module. This project is a console app, using the algorithm in a demonstration.
